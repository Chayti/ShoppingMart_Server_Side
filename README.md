Important features of my site are:
* Home page has a header (simple navbar), carousel, extra banners for website necessity, products, reviews, and footer. On the home page, the products have a maximum of 4 items. I put 4 products in a row based on my design. Each product has a relevant name, image, short description, add a buy now button. If a user clicks on the purchase or buy now button it will take the user to the purchase page.
* This website has two side: Admin side, User side. Admins will handle the whole functionality like (manage all products, manage orders, make admin, add a new product etc.) Users will have a dashboard after login where he/she will get many routes like : my orders, payment, add review etc. The Payment page will show the total price of all ordered products along with 2 payment system options like, “Cash on delivery” and “Online payment”. If the user choose, “Cash on delivery” option, the user will see the message “Thanks! Our delivery man will contact you in time.” If the user chooses the 2nd option, “This facility is coming soon…” message will appear.
* The user can see some of our products at home page. To have a look on all of our products, he/she will have to visit our more products page. From these, he/she can buy any product. But this place order page will act like a private/ protected route. Then, in the form, ncessary information will be taken from user for order purpose.
* Technologies used: react redux, redux toolkit, react routing, private routing, admin routing, custom hook, context api, react-hook-form, react-rating, react-fontawesome, firebase authentication (google sign in, email & password login), firebase deploy (live site), heroku deploy (server site) etc. with beauitiful UI.
* For UI design, we used bootstrap, react bootstrap, Material UI, Vanilla CSS. This site is responsive & it has a 404 page also.
